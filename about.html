      <p>
        Hi!! I'm Roshini Saravanakumar, and I'm really excited that you're here.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Let me tell you my story.</strong></p>

      <p>
        My journey began two years ago as an incoming freshman in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign. I've lived in California for nearly my entire life, so the fact that I was halfway across the
        country with no connections and surrounded by flat land (no hills?Â¿!) absolutely blew. my. mind. ðŸ¤¯
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm an adventurer. My curious brain simply <em>refuses</em> to live a normal, passive life. College was by far
        my biggest adventure (and challenge) yet, and I was <strong>thrilled</strong> to live it to my fullest. Despite
        barely knowing how to code, I was so excited to start learning that I would read my Introduction to Computing
        Systems textbook for fun ðŸ¤“ while listening to
        <a href='#indie-games'>my favorite Indie game soundtracks</a>.
        My early efforts and hard work certainly paid off as my success in these inital courses set the
        foundation for my lifelong love of Computer Engineering.
      </p>

      <p>In the past two years, I have designed and built projects from scratch that I could have never dreamt of
        creating prior to college. Here are some of my favorites.
        <ul>
          <li>I built an operating system from scratch after only two semesters of college. (Fall 2018)</li>
          <li>I wrote a device driver for a game controller and of course, I programmed the 7-segment display to say
            "dab". (Fall 2018)</li>
          <li>I recreated one of my favorite multiplayer childhood car racing games for the FPGA and designed all the
            sprites by hand. (Spring 2019)</li>
          <li>I created visualizations and powerful learning experiences from <em>huge</em> datasets relevant to my
            studies and <a href='lifestyle.html'>my transition to a more sustainable lifestyle</a>. (Spring 2019)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also met my lovely best friends, saw snow for the first time â›„ (!!! This is very exciting to me as a
        Californian ðŸ˜‚),
        begun <a href='lifestyle.html'>my transformative journey into mindfulness and yoga</a>,
        made tons of art,
        <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74783079-roshini' target='_blank'> read 15 books for fun ðŸ“š</a>,
        resurrected a jasmine tree ðŸŒ±, and decided to create this blog to record these adventures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school, I love exploring my creativity in its countless other forms. Prior to college, I had
        picked up bullet journaling as a method to track my tasks and achievements. However, through college, my
        bullet journal has become my go-to location to explore and record my thoughts, artwork, calligraphy, to-do
        lists and passions. Around the same time that I began bullet journaling, I became interested in brush
        calligraphy and I have been practicing it ever since.
      </p>

      <p id='indie-games'>
        In my free time, I also love listening to music (especially Indie game soundtracks) and creating my own music
        on the piano. Speaking of Indie games, my absolute favorite genre in gaming is Indie games, simply because
        they have a perfectly entrancing blend of music, art, and story; one that truly speaks to my heart ðŸ’œ. I am
        also a huge fan of puzzle games, especially
        <a href='http://www.rustylake.com/' target='_blank'>Rusty Lake's Cube Escape series</a>!
        Some of my all time favorite Indie games, with links to their soundtracks (or website if not available) are:
        <a href='https://victorbutzelaar.bandcamp.com/album/rusty-lake-paradise-soundtrack' target='_blank'>Rusty Lake:
          Paradise</a>,
        <a href='https://victorbutzelaar.bandcamp.com/album/rusty-lake-paradox' target='_blank'>Rusty Lake: Paradox</a>,
        <a href='https://youtu.be/7aDWVDuRCiA' target='_blank'>Monument Valley</a>,
        <a href='http://thesilentage.com/' target='_blank'>The Silent Age</a>,
        <a href='https://youtu.be/c3Vk5zjyRVE' target='_blank'>Nihilumbra</a>, and
        <a href='https://playdead.com/games/limbo/' target='_blank'>Limbo</a>.

        I have also fallen in love with several soundtracks of games that I currently cannot afford to buy
        (<a href='hire.html'>I'm looking for internships!</a>), but would love to play in the near future.
        These include:
        <a href='https://youtu.be/M3hFN8UrBPw' target='_blank'>Journey</a>,
        <a href='https://youtu.be/TCuhQLgDgIg' target='_blank'>Abzu</a>,
        <a href='https://youtu.be/TqOVpiXfq0o' target='_blank'>Braid</a> (I've only played the demo; it's so beautiful
        ðŸ’›),
        <a href='https://youtu.be/6aHknzoG8G0' target='_blank'>The Last Guardian</a>, and
        <a href='https://youtu.be/MkzeOmkOUHM' target='_blank'>Ori and the Blind Forest</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also been a book nerd practically since the moment I laid finger on the countless folktale and fairytale
        books my mom read to me as a child. Although my all-time favorite genres are fantasy, science-fiction and
        mystery,
        in the past few years, I have dipped my feet into the self-help genre, in an effort to discover habits and ideas
        that would help me piece my life back together after being in a mental slump for a year. Many of the books that
        I
        picked up, starting with <em>The Book of Joy</em> by the 14th Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu in my freshman year of
        college, drastically shifted the lens through which I see our world. They have taught me invaluable skills from
        time management to living my life in the present moment. Most importantly, they have taught me that I am capable
        of learning and achieving so much if I simply go for it. I take the lessons I have learned from these books with
        me into my everyday interactions with others and the world, treating everyone with compassion and kindness, and
        exploring what it truly means to be alive and thriving. <a href='#'>Here's a list of the 5 books that have
          completely transformed my perspective on life.</a>

        <a href='contact.html'>I would love to give you my time.</a>
