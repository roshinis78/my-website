            Hi!! I'm Roshini Saravanakumar, and I'm really excited that you're here.
            <strong>Let me tell you my story.</strong>

            My journey began two years ago as an incoming freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
            I've
            lived a majority of my life in California and I rarely travel, so the fact that I was halfway across the
            country with no connections absolutely blew. my. mind. I had applied into Computer Engineering as a
            last-minute effort to choose between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, so I was slightly nervous,
            especially since I barely knew how to code prior to college. Little did I know at the time, in less than a
            semester, I was certain that Computer Engineering was truly my passion and I would simply <em>love</em>
            every
            ECE course I took.

          <p>In the past two years, I have built an operating system from scratch, recreated one of my
            favorite childhood games for the FPGA, created visualizations and user interfaces to create learning
            experiences from <em>huge</em> datasets, and successfully completed so many projects that I had only ever
            dreamt of being a part of. I also met my lovely best friends, saw snow â›„ (!!! This is very exciting to me as
            a
            Californian ðŸ˜‚), begun my transformative journey into mindfulness and yoga, and learned skills that empower
            and motivate me to take on the projects and challenges I encounter everyday.

            Outside of school, I love exploring my creativity in its countless other forms. Prior to college, I had
            picked
            up bullet journaling as a method to track my tasks and achievements. However, through college, my bullet
            journal has become my go-to location to explore and record my thoughts, artwork, calligraphy, to-do lists
            and
            passions. Around the same time that I began bullet journaling, I became interested in brush calligraphy and
            I
            have been practicing it ever since. I have always had an inexplicable love for expressing my feelings and
            ideas and recreating my reality through art, especially through watercolor and abstract doodles. Many of
            these
            works find their home in my bullet journal, but a good portion of them find their way to my wall or to my
            friends and family.

            In my free time, I also love listening to music (especially Indie game soundtracks) and creating my own
            music
            on the piano. Speaking of Indie games, my absolute favorite genre in gaming is Indie games, simply because
            they have a perfectly entrancing blend of music, art, and story; one that truly speaks to my heart ðŸ’œ. I am
            also a huge fan of puzzle games, especially <a>Rusty Lake's Cube Escape series</a>!

            Here are some other video games that have struck a chord with my imagination and soul:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Monument Valley</li>
            <li>Silent Age</li>
            <li>Abzu</li>
            <li>Braid</li>
            <li>Nihilumbra</li>
            <li>Limbo and many more...</li>
          </ul>

            I've also been a book nerd practically since the moment I laid finger on the countless folktale and
            fairytale
            books my mom read to me as a child. In the past few years, I have dipped my feet into the self-help genre,
            in
            an effort to discover habits and ideas that would help me piece my life back together after being in a
            mental
            slump for a year. Many of the books that I picked up, starting with <em>The Book of Joy</em> by the
            fourteenth
            Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu in my freshman year of college, drastically shifted the lens through which I see
            our world. They have taught me skills from time management to focusing on the present moment, and most
            importantly, they have taught me that I am capable of learning and achieving so much if I simply go for it.
            I
            take this philosophy with me into my everyday interactions with others and the world, treating everyone with
            compassion and kindness, and exploring what it truly means to be alive and thriving.
